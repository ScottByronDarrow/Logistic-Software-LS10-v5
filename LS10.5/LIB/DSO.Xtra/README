The extra library I've created here is simply to satisfy an external
request for programs that do NOT already supply definitions for:
	gljc_rec
	gljc_no_fields
	gljc_list
	glwk_rec
Since the library modules that reference these variables in libbase are not
used if this library gets *included* (OK bad pun), I'm not defining much
in the way of real storage

Also, due to an existing *BUG* in the INFORMIX C-ISAM Library (libisam.a) that
I converted into a DSO (libisam.so), I had to manually extract sort.o from it
and retain it as a static object with libDSOXtra.a
