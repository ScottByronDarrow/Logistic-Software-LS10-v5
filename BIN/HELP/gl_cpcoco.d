  ^1General Ledger Company to Company Copy.^6
    
    This option provides the facility to copy one companys entire chart of
    accounts  into  another.   The program will not allow accounts  to  be
    copied and created where existing accounts exist.
    
    The  option also allows budgets to be copied over as well.  If however
    the  two  companies concerned have different financial year  ends  the
    individual  period  amounts in period 1 will be copied to period 1  in
    company 2. This may be July in company 1 and January in company 2.
    
    It is still necessary to maintain the GL page number option to set the
    consolidation  flags.   Also the Branch interface file (glat) and  the
    individual category interface tables have to be established also.
