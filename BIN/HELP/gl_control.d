   The  Suspense  Account serves as a Default Account where an  interface
    for Sales/Debtors has not been established.  The postings will be made
    to this account.
    NOTE  :   The C.O.S/Stock Interface is not a mandatory  posting.   For
    categories  not  set  up,  these will not automatically  post  to  the
    Suspense Account.  They will simply not post.
    
    It  is  not  mandatory to set up the Stock/C.O.S  Interface  for  each
    category.  If these interfaces are not set up, THEY WILL NOT BE POSTED
    TO  THE SUSPENSE ACCOUNT.  The C.O.S/Stock element of the sale may  be
    entered  via  General  Journal using a Opening Stock and  Purchases  -
    Closing Stock calculation.
    
    Therefore  ensure  that  new stock categories  have  their  interfaces
    established before invoicing occurs.
