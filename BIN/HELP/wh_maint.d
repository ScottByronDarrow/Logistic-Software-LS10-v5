^11st stock Picking Order^6
First stock picking order can be a location type, lot/location expiry date
or FIFO order to pick from lot/locations.
This is always the first rule that is used when picking stock.

^1Pick flags^6
Pick flags defines the valid location types to work with the rule defined.
Say you want to pick in location type order first but only for the loose 
location. You would define the 1st stock picking order as 'L(ocation' and 
the Pick flags would contain only 'L(oose)'

^12nd stock Picking Order^6
    See 1st picking order.

^13rd stock Picking Order^6

^1Allow Alternate UOM^6
Allow alternate UOM defines if stock can be picked from UOM's other than what 
the operator selected. If for example you wanted 100 Box 24's and the system 
had only 50. The system would allocate the 50 then supply the balance from an 
alternate such as box 100's.

^1Allow Auto Allocation^6
This tells the system to perform allocation automatically based on the rules
defined in the pick order fields above. Setting this to N(o) will cause a 
lot more work for operators.

^1Allow Expired Items^6
This tells the system to allow or ignore expired lots.

^1Display All Locations^6
Turing this on will cause all lots to be displayed even ones with zero 
quantities. Recomendation is to set to N(o).
