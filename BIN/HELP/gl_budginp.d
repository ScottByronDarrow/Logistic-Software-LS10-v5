  ^1MAINTAIN BUDGETS^6
    
    Up  to  twenty  Budget sets may be established per  Company,  for  the
    current  year  and  the next year.  It is possible to  have  different
    annual  values and monthly spreads for the current year and next  year
    for the same budget file.  Budgets are held on the glpd file at period
    level.  For annual figures the values for each period are accumulated.
    When  an  annual  value is spread any remainder is added  into  period
    twelve.
    
    Each Budget set is assigned a Number and Title.
    
    Accounts  can  be selected from any level and can have budget  amounts
    entered  and  spread tables assigned for the spreading of the  amounts
    over  the  various months.  Amounts are imploded up the Account  tree.

    If  budgets  are entered at two levels the values will  accumulate  at
    higher level accounts for example if you select all levels and enter a
    Budget value at level two then entry one at level three, the level two
    amount will reflect both values.
    
    NOTE  :  When adding or amending Budget values you must first tag  the
    lines  for amendment, select the spread method then spread them  using
    the S^1[P]^6READ option.  The ^1[P]^6 option creates the monthly values on the
    glpd file.
    
    The  individual  figures  etc  can  be reported  on  and  the  details
    incorporated into the financial statements for the Company.
