 ^1MAINTAIN ACCOUNT DESCRIPTIONS^6
    
    This  option provides for the establishment and maintenance of account
    codes  and  descriptions  at  the various levels  within  the  account
    structure.   For  example  If  level  one is  a  two  digit  code  and
    represents  the various Branches in the organisation then the  account
    level  will  be number one and the account number will be a two  digit
    code.
    
    The  account  number  prompt below will display the number  of  digits
    relevant to the level of the account.  For example If the account code
    structure  is  XX-XXX-XXXX, at level three the account  number  prompt
    will show four digits.

    Once  the account descriptions have been established for all codes  at
    the various levels, individual account codes can be created using  the
    account maintenance option.
    
    The  individual accounts at level one must be established first before
    level  two  accounts are established.  When the option is entered  the
    cursor  will  prompt at level number and display at the bottom of  the
    screen  the  level range.  The level range will be determined  by  the
    account code structure established when the System was first set up.
