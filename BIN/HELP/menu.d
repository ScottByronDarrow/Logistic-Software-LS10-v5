                 ^1 Using numeric keys to select options. ^6

  If the number preceding the option is keyed the reverse bar will move to
  that option.  

  In the case of options greater than 9 the reverse bar will move to option 1 
  when the ^1 1 ^6 key is pressed, then option 15 say, when the ^1 5 ^6 key is 
  pressed.  

  If an attempt is made to select an option greater than the number of options 
  displayed, the reverse bar will move to number of the last key pressed.

                 ^1 Using Fast access to select options. ^6

  Each Menu has an unique identifier of a maximum of 6 characters.  
  This identifier is known as the ^1Fast Access Code^6 for that menu.  

  To use the Fast Access System the user should type the Code of the menu 
  required ie MAIN for the main menu.  If the ^1RETURN^6 or ^1ENTER^6 key is 
  pressed the menu related to the code will be displayed.  

  If a number is keyed before the ^1RETURN^6 or ^1ENTER^6 key is pressed, and 
  the number refers to a valid option on the menu, the menu related to the 
  code will be displayed, with the reverse bar positioned over the option 
  selected.  ie MAIN5 will position the cursor on the 5th option in the main 
  menu.  If there is no menu associated with the code, or there is no valid 
  options for the user on the menu the current menu will be displayed with 
  the reverse bar position remaining unchanged.
